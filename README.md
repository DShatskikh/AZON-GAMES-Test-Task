Test task

Make a mini-game in which you need to control a knight and chop down bandits.
1. The start screen is a darkened screen with the Play and Exit buttons.

2. When the Play button is pressed, the character is activated. The UI displays
the number of knight lives and the number of bandits killed.

3. Character control
A / Left arrow - move left
D / right arrow - move to the right
Shift - somersault
The left mouse button is a punch
Space - jump
The character should not run over the edges of the screen.
4. The location must have at least one platform on which the knight can jump.
5. Bandits run out from the left and right sides of the screen and attack the
knight. We need to kill as many bandits as possible.

6. After the player's death, the final menu with buttons is displayed
Restart and Exit.

7. The orientation of the game is horizontal.
Everything should look good at any screen size and
aspect ratio.
Pack the UI in an atlas.
